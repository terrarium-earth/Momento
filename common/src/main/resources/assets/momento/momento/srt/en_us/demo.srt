Hello, my name is Adrian, and this
is a demo for the project Momento.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,060
Momento is a tool that allows pack
makers and mod authors to add audio logs

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,860
to their mods and mod packs for lore.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,240
Right clicking the momento item or
triggering the /dialogue command

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,020
will begin the audio playback,
and a text box will appear on the

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,080
player screen with subtitles that
will sync along to the audio.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,680
To get started, create a resource
pack that a Momento will use

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,910
to create your dialogues.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,020
You can use any audio recorder that
you'd like to make your audio, and then

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,660
you'll need to export it as a .OGG file.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,780
Add this sound like you would
any other sound and remember the

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,080
reference to it that you created
it and your sounds.json file.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,860
Next you'll need to create a
dialogue and subtitle file.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,459
The dialogue file must be placed under
assets/{your modid}/momento/dialogue

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
. It's a JSON file, which you
can learn how to configure.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,790
Over on our Wiki at
modrinth.com/mod/momento.

17
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,460
And clicking the Wiki link.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,240
For your subtitle file, you
can use a tool like Descript to

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,590
transcribe your audio automatically,
creating matching subtitles.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:18,759
Export your file as a .SRT file
and place it in assets/{your modid}/momento/srt/en_us.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,590
You can replace en_us with
whatever language you'd like

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,700
to create your subtitles in.

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,840
Add this resource back to your
resources folder and start your game.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,040
In the creative menu, you should
see a brand new momento item.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,140
That's the end of the tutorial.

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,170
